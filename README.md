Update 2.0
# My Portfolio(Whats NEW🤩)

Welcome to my updated portfolio! In this version, I've added exciting new features and improvements to enhance the user experience and interaction. Additionally, I've integrated a "Send Message" option and implemented comprehensive form validation to ensure accurate data entry.

## New Features

### Send Message Option

Now, you can easily get in touch with me using the "Send Message" option. Simply visit the Contact section of my portfolio and fill out the form to send me a message directly. I've implemented form validation to ensure that the information you provide is accurate and complete. Real-time feedback will guide you in filling out the form correctly.

### Form Validation

I've integrated form validation throughout the portfolio to ensure accurate and error-free data entry. Validation is applied to fields such as First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Mobile Number, and Message. Error messages are displayed if any information is incomplete or incorrectly formatted.

## Connecting to the MySQL Database (Using XAMPP)

To save the details submitted through the "Send Message" option, you can use XAMPP to set up a MySQL database. Follow these steps:

1. **Install and Start XAMPP:**
   Download and install XAMPP from [https://www.apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org). Start the Apache and MySQL modules.

2. **Create Database:**
   Open phpMyAdmin (usually accessed at http://localhost/phpmyadmin) and create a new database named `portfolio_data`.

3. **Import SQL File:**
   Import the `portfolio_data.sql` file provided in the repository. This file contains the necessary table structure for storing contact details.

4. **PHP Code for Database Connection:**
   Create a PHP file (e.g., `db_connect.php`) to establish a connection to the MySQL server. Here's an example of what the file may look like:

   ```php
   <?php
   // Database configuration
   $servername = "localhost";
   $username = "your_username";
   $password = "your_password";
   $dbname = "portfolio_data";

   // Create connection
   $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

   // Check connection
   if ($conn->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }
   ?>
Replace your_username and your_password with your MySQL username and password.
